## Lecture 3: List1, References and Recursion

**The Golden Rule of Equals (GRoE)**:
Given variables y and x:
`y = x` **copies** all the **bits** from x into y.

There are 9 types of variables in Java:
- 8 primitive types (boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, double).
- **References** to objects, and References may be *null*

All of these types of variables obey *GRoE*:
1. For primitive types, `y = x` just copies x’s bits, which represents its value, into y, for instance:
	```java
	int x = 16;		// the bits of x is 10000
	int y = x;		// copy 10000 from x into y
	```
2. For References, `y = x` also copies x’s bits, which represents not only its value but also the address of the object x points, into y, for instance:
	```java
	Dog x = new Dog("pipi");	// suppose Dog is a class
	Dog y = x;	// now y points the same Dog as x
	```
3. Passing parameters also obeys **GRoE**, copying the bits.

**The Initialization of References**
All of references, except *null*, is initialized with 3 steps:
1. Declaration: create a 64 bit box for storing an Object address;
2. Instantiation: create a new Object (for example, an int array);
3. Assignment: put the address of the Object into the 64 bit box.

## Lecture 4: List2, SLList

**Static nested classes**: a nested class that never uses any *instance* variables or methods (OK if uses static) of its outer class should be declared *static*.

Using static nested classes results in a minor memory saving. Just like static methods had no way to access “my” instance variables/methods because it doesn’t bind with a object, static classes also cannot access “my” outer class’s instance variables, since it doesn’t have a pointer pointing a outer class object (also part the reason for saving memory).

**Sentinel nodes**: A node even in front of the first node of a List, making all Lists (include empty) the “same” to avoid “special cases”.
> Tip for being a good programmer: Keep Code Simple

## Lecture 5: List3, DLList and Array

**Double Linked List (DLList)**: Unlike Singly Linked List (SLList) which only has links of single direction (next) and one sentinel, DLList has links of bi-direction (prev, next), as well as double sentinels (sentFront, sentBack) or a circular sentinel, so that it’s more fast for DLList to finish some tasks like addLast.

1. Double sentinels: the *sentFront* sentinel’s next points to the first real node, while the *sentBack* sentinel’s prev points to the last real node.
2. Circular Sentinel: just one *sentinel* whose next points to the first node and prev points to the last node.

> Both 1 and 2 is to solve the special case if we only have a last pointer pointing the last note of DLList. In this case, last may either points to the sentinel (empty) or a real node.

**Three ways of instantiating Arrays**:

1. `int[] x = new int[3];`
2. `int[] y = new int[]{1, 2, 3};`
3. `int[] z = {1, 2, 3};`

**Two ways of copying Arrays**:

1. Element by element using a loop.
2. `System.arraycopy(from, from_begin, to, to_begin, num to copy);`

**2D Arrays (Arrays of Array Address)**:
```java
int[][] a = new int[4][];
int[][] b = new int[4][4];
int[][] c = new int[][]{{1}, {1,2}, {1,2,3}, {1,2,3,4}};
```
 
## Lecture 8: Inheritance, Implements

### Overloading

**Overloading** means that we can have *multiple methods* with same name, but different parameters:
```java
void longest (ArrayList<String>);
void printAB (LinkedList<String>);
```

**Downside**:
- Code of these methods may be identical.
- Won’t work for another class, such as a customized List.
- Hard to maintain & debug: to fix a bug, you must fix it in all methods.

### Interface Inheritance

**Hypernym and Hyponym**: Hypernym treats things from a general level, while hyponym treats things from a specific level. For instance, both AList and BList is a type of List, so we say they are *hyponym* of List, and List is *hypernym* of them.

**Interface** is used to describe a *hypernym*, similar to a class except that it’s a specification of _what_ an object is able to do, _not how_ to do it.

> So the definition of a interface only contains declared methods without implementations, which will be implemented in a hyponym class.

**Implementing an interface**: when defining a class, we use *implements* keyword to specify of which hyponyms/interfaces this class is. This is also called **Interface Inheritance** and the class can be seen as a *subclass* inherits the interface from a superclass.

```java
// a hypernym interface of all List
public interface List61B<Item> {
	public void addFirst(Item x);
	...
}
// a hyponym class of List61B
public class AList61B<Item> implements List61B<Item> {
	public void addFirst(Item x) {
		...
	}
	...
}
```

> Subclasses **must** override all of methods declared in interfaces. 

**Overriding** means that a “subclass” has a method with the same *signature* as in the “superclass”. (say the subclass *overrides* the method).

We should mark every overriding method with **@Override** annotation so that it won’t be compiled successfully if it isn’t a real overriding method.

Though an interface should only contain declaration of methods, it can also provide some *default* implementations of methods by using *default* keyward, which will be used in subclasses if not overrided.

### Keys that inheritance works: static type and dynamic type

**Static type**: variables’ “compile-time type” specified at *declaration* and never changed.

**Dynamic type**: variables’ “run-time type” specified at *instantiation* (e.g. using *new*) and equal to the type of the object being pointed at.

**Dynamic method selection**: if we call a method of an object using a variable with:
- compile-time/static type X;
- run-time/dynamic type Y
Then if Y *overrides* the method, Y’s method is used in this call.

**Method selection algorithm**:
Take the function call `foo.bar(x1)` as the example, where `foo` has static type `TPrime`, and `x1` has static type `T1`.

At compile time, the compiler verifies that `TPrime` type has a method that can handle `T1`, and records the signature of the method.
- If `TPrime` has multiple methods that can handle `T1`, the compiler records the “most specific” one (subclass rather than superclass).

At run time, if `foo`’s dynamic type overrides the *recorded signature*, then use the overridden method. Otherwise, use `TPrime`’s version of the method.

## Lecture 9: Extends, Casting, Higher Order Functions

### Implementation Inheritance: extends

When a class is a hyponym of an *interface*, we used **implements**, while a class is a hyponym of *another class*, instead of an interface, we use **extends** keyword.

With extends, the subclass inherits all members of its superclass, (except members inaccessible to it such as private):
- All instances and static variables;
- All methods;
- All nested classes.

> Constructors are not inherited. Every class should have its won constructors!

If you want to call a method of superclass version, do as below:
```java
super.methodName();
```

**Constructor Behavior**: all constructors must start with a call to one of the superclass’s constructors. You can call it with the keyword  `super(parameters)`, or Java will automatically call (only) superclass’s non-parameter constructor.

> Idea behind the rule: every object of subclass must be an object of superclass first. A cat must be an animal first.

> Both implements and extends are a **is-a** relationships, rather than **has-a**.

### Modules and Encapsulation (封装)

**Module** is a set of methods that work together as a whole to perform set of related tasks.

A module is said to be **encapsulated** if its implementation is *completely hidden* to users and can be accessed only through a documented interface.

### Higher Order Functions (HoF)
A function that treats another function as data, e.g. takes a function as parameter.
```java
public class Java8FuncRef {
	public static int tenX(int x) {
		return 10*x;
	}
	public static int doTwice(Function<Integer, Integer> f, int x) {
		f.apply(f.apply(x));
	}
	public void static void main(String[] args) {
int result = doTwice(Java8FuncRef::tenX, 2);  // result=200.
	}
}
```

## Lecture 10:

### Polymorphism
Provide a single interface to entities of different types. Both interface and implementation inheritance are polymorphism.

### Comparable vs. Comparator
The built-in **Comparable** interface provides a class with the ability to compare as “Natural Order”, because ‘\<‘ cannot be used to compare between objects. For instance, `Dog` is *comparable* in terms of size:
```java
public interface Comparable<T> {
	int compareTo(T t);
}
// Dog.java
public class Dog implements Comparable<Dog> {
	private int size;
	public int compareTo(Dog d) {
		return this.size - d.size;
	}
}
```

However, it’s not enough sometimes to compare two objects only as the “Natural Order”. We may want to compare between two dogs in terms of their name.

The built-in **Comparator** interface is used to define ways we compare objects. Classes implementing *Comparator* interface are only used for comparation:
```java
public interface Comparator<T> {
	int compare(T o1, T o2);
}
// Dog.java
public class Dog implements Comparable<Dog> {
	...
	private String name;
	// Now we can compare two Dog in terms of their names.
	public static class NameComparator implements Comparator<Dog> {
		public int compare(Dog d1, Dog d2) {
			return d1.name.compareTo(d2.name);
		}
	}
	// If we want to compare their weights, just implement another
	// Comparator<Dog>.
}
```

**Two more uses for interfaces**:
1. Specify a contract for common behavior shard by many data structure (e.g. *Comparable* interface);
2. Provide a way to containerize common functions (e.g. *Comparator* interface).

## Lecture 11: Libraries

**Abstract Data Types (ADT)**: defined only by their operations (declarations), not by their implementations. Interface can be seen as ADT.
> Interfaces can also extend other interfaces.

**Factory Methods for Collections**: create immutable collections in one line; underlying implementation is hidden from users.
```java
Set<Integer> S = Set.of(3,4,5,6);
Map<String, Integer> numLegs = Map.of("horse", 4, "dog", 4);
```

### Interfaces and Abstract Classes
Inheritance by now:
- Interface inheritance: what a class can do (declaration, interface).
- Implementation inheritance: How a class does it (definition, extends class, default methods of interface).

**Properties of interfaces**:
1. Unless described with **default**, a method will be **abstract**;
2. Unless specified an access modifier, a method will be **public**;
3. Can only define **public static final** variables (constants);
4. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

**Abstract classes**: an intermediate level between interfaces and classes:
1. Cannot be instantiated either.
2. Provide either **abstract** or **concrete** methods:
	- Use **abstract** keyword for abstract methods;
	- Use no word for concrete methods.
3. Provide any kind of variables.
4. Provide protected and package private methods.
5. Subclasses only extend one abstract class.

### Packages
`import static packagename` can be used to import static members of a class.

## Lecture 13: Syntax1

### Autoboxing / Auto-unboxing
Implicit conversions between primitives and their corresponding wrappers.
1. Arrays are never autoboxed/unboxed. So an Integer[] cannot be used in place of an int[] or vice versa.
2. Autoboxing/unboxing incurs a measurable performance impact.
3. Wrapper types use much more memory (more like any class).

**A similar conversion - Primitive widening**: moving from a primitive type with a *narrower* range to a *wider* range, say, from int to double:
```java
public static void add1(double x) {
	x = x+1;
}
public static void add2(int x) {
	x = x+1;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
	int x = 1;
	add1(x);	// Ok, and we say the value x is widened.
	double y = 2.0;
	add2((int) y);	// wrong if call add2(y), have mistakes.
```

### Immutable data types
cannot change in any observable way after *instantiation*, like `Integer`, `String`.

Keyword **final** can help compilers ensure immutability.

**Final** only makes a variable’s bits fixed. If the variable is primitive, its value is fixed; if the variable is a reference, the address stored in its memory is fixed (which object it points at), (the object the reference points at is also changeable!)

## Lecture 14: Exceptions, Iterations

### Exceptions
Java can throw exceptions explicitly with **throw** keyword:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("A runtime exception will be thrown.");
	throw new RuntimeException("For no reason.");
}
```

Java can also **catch** and handle exceptions with `try {..} catch {...}` blocks to prevent program from crashing:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	try {
		throw new RuntimeException("Let's throw a exception");
	} catch (RuntimeException re) {
		System.out.println("Aha, I catch a runtimeException!");
	} catch (Exception e) {
		System.out.println("In case there are also other exceptions.");
	}
}
```

**Unchecked exception**: compilation will succeed without checking, while the program may crash at runtime. Any subclass of *RuntimeException* and *Error* is unchecked.

**Checked exception**: compilation will fail if checked exceptions are not *caught* or *specified*. All other *Throwables* are checked.
1. Catch: use catch block to handle checked exceptions;
2. Specify methods will throw these exceptions with *throws* keyword.
	```java
	public static void printFile() throws IOException {
		...
		throw new IOException("hi");
	}
	```
> *Catch* itself will handle the checked exceptions, while *specify* will defer other methods to handle the checked exceptions. With these two ways, a checked exception is ensured to be handled.

### Iterations: enhanced for loop
We see that “foreach” is much more convenient than a normal for loop. **Iteration** provide us with a way to build our classes that support “foreach”.

Two interfaces, `Iterable` and `Iterator`. are needed for a class to support “foreach”:
```java
interface Iterable<T> {
	Iterator<T> iterator();
}

interface Iterator<T> {
	boolean hasNext();
	T next();
}
```

We first make the class (ArrayMap, for example) implement the `Iterable` interface, which will return a `Iterator` that specify how to finish “foreach”:
```java
public class ArrayMap<K, V> implements Iterable<K> {
	...
	@Override
	public Iterator<K> Iterator() {
		return new KeyIterator();
}
```

Then we define a KeyIterator that extends Iterator:
```java
public class KeyIterator implements Iterator<K> {
	private int ptr;
	public KeyIterator() {
		ptr = 0;
	}
	public boolean hasNext() {return ptr != size; }
	public K next() {...}
}
```

## Lecture 15: Packages, access control

### Creating a package
1. Put the package name at the top of every file in the package;
2. Make sure files are stored in folders with the appropriate folder names.

### Access control
1. **public**: all classes can access;
2. **protected**: classes within the same package and subclasses can access;
3. **package private (default)**: classes with in the same package can access (subclasses cannot);
4. **private**: class itself can access.

**Why package members are more “secret” than subclasses?**
1. Extending classes you didn’t write is common;
2. Packages are modified only by a specific team of humans.

## Lecture 16: Programming efficiently, API, ADT, Views

**API**: Application programming interface of an ADT is the list of constructors and methods, including an informal description of the effect of each.

### Three ways of implementing Stack using List
1. Extension
```java
public class ExtensionStack<Item> extends LinkedList<Item> {
	public void push(Item x) {
		add(x);
	}
}
```
2. Delegation
```java
public class DelegationStack<Item> {
	private LinkedList<Item> L = new LinkedList<Item>();
	public void push(Item x) {
		L.add(x);
	}
}
```
3. Adaptation
```java
public class stackAdapter<Item> {
	private List L;
	public stackAdapter(List<Item> worker) {
		L = worker;
	}
	public void push(Item x) {
		L.add(x);
	}
}
```

### Views
> An alternative representation of an existing object.
> Concrete objects
> Access is limited
> But changes mutate the underlying object.
